          Terms of Service
        </h1>

        Please read these terms carefully. By using the OmniCo and hence signing up for an Account you agree to these terms. This is a legal document.

        "OmniCo" is owned by the company OmniCo with its headquarters in Istanbul, Turkey. As a customer of this service you are a „User“ or „You“ according to this agreement. Any services offered by us will be referred to as „OmniCo“ or „Service“.

        WhatsApp®, Facebook® Messenger®, Turkcell BIP and Telegram as well as their respective logos are registered trademarks and not affiliated with OmniCo.
        <br>
        <h2>
          1. Eligibility
        </h2>
        In order to use OmniCo, you must:
        be at least eighteen (18) years old and able to enter into contracts;
        complete the registration process;
        agree to the Terms; and
        provide true, complete, and up to date contact information.
        By using OmniCo, you represent and warrant that you meet all the requirements listed above, and that you won’t use OmniCo in a way that violates any laws or regulations. OmniCo may refuse service, close accounts of any users, and change eligibility requirements at any time.
        <br>
      <h2>2. Term</h2>
        The Term begins when you sign up for OmniCo and continues as long as you use the Service. Clicking the button and entering your username means that you’ve officially “signed” the Terms. If you sign up for OmniCo on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on their behalf.
        <br>
        <h2>
          3. Closing your Account
        </h2>
        You or OmniCo may terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason by giving Notice to the other party. We may suspend our Service to you at any time, with or without cause. If we terminate your Account without cause, we'll refund a prorated portion of your monthly prepayment. We won’t refund or reimburse you if there’s cause, like a violation of these Terms. Once terminated, we may permanently delete your Account and all the data associated with it.
        <br>
        <h2>
          4. Changes
        </h2>
        We may change any of the Terms by posting revised Terms of Use on our Website and/or by sending an email to the last email address you gave us. Unless you terminate your Account within ten (10) days, the new Terms will be effective immediately and apply to any continued or new use of OmniCo. We may change the Website, the Service, or any features of the Service at any time.
        <br>
        <h2>
          5. Account and Password
        </h2>
        You’re responsible for keeping your Account name and password confidential. You’re also responsible for any Account that you have access to, whether or not you authorized the use. You’ll immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your accounts. We’re not responsible for any losses due to stolen or hacked passwords. We don’t have access to your current password, and for security reasons, we may only reset your password.
        <br>
        <h2>
          6. Payment
        </h2>
        Our charges for monthly plans are posted on our Website and may be changed to reflect upgrades and changes of features. Payments are due for any month on the same date, or the closest date in that month, to the day you signed up with us and made your first monthly payment after the Trail Period (the "Pay Date"). If you reach another pricing level, then you'll have to pay at the higher level on or before the next pay date.

        The product is available in different pricing plans and including various messaging networks, e.g. WhatsApp®, Facebook® Messenger, BIP  and Telegram® Messenger. Additional costs that might occur from these networks are not covered by OmniCo.
        <br>
        <h2>
          7. Credit Cards
        </h2>
        As long as you’re a Member or have an outstanding balance with us, you'll provide us with valid credit card information and authorize us to deduct the monthly charges against that credit card. You’ll replace the information for any credit card that expires with information for a different valid credit card. Anyone using a credit card represents and warrants that he or she is authorized to use that credit card, and that any and all charges may be billed to that credit card and won’t be rejected.

        If, for some reason, we’re unable to process your credit card order, we’ll try to contact you by email and suspend your Account until your payment can be processed.
        <br>
        <h2>
          8. Refunds
        </h2>
        You are not entitled to a refund if your Account was blocked or discontinued by the messaging networks that are supported on the platform, which we have no influence over. We may offer a refund case by case, if a User applies for one.
        <br>
        <h2>
          9. Changes
        </h2>
        We may change our monthly fees at any time by posting new pricing plans on the Website and/or by sending you a Notification via email.
        <br>
        <h2>
          10. Marketing
        </h2>
        Depending on the information you provide us, we may use the company information for marketing purposes such as displaying testimonials including the company's name and/or logo. Personal user data, conversations on the platform or any other private information (e.g. payment information) are not subject to the aforementioned marketing purposes.
        <br>
        <h2>
          11. Privacy Policy
        </h2>
        The Privacy Policy will be treated as part of these Terms.
        <br>
        <h2>
          12. General Rules
        </h2>

        <br>
        <h2>

        </h2>
        You are aware that OmniCo is not affiliated with any messaging network such as WhatsApp®, Facebook® Messenger, Viber®, Kik® and Telegram® Messenger — OmniCo is solely providing a service built on top of these networks. These networks may change/extend/close the availabality of their services at any time which directly affects the availability of OmniCo.

        As a user of OmniCo, you agree that OmniCo is not liable for the full availability of the afore mentioned networks at any time.

        <h2>

        <br>

        </h2>
